                <ol>
                    <h2>Teams</h2>
                    <p>There are two teams.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Terrorist ( T )
                            <a href="https://csgoskins.gg/sides/terrorists"> How T look like </a>
                        </li>

                        <li>Counter-Terrorist ( CT )
                            <a href="https://csgoskins.gg/sides/counter-terrorists"> How CT look like </a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Maps</h2>
                    <p>The maps currently in the active duty pool, and one must be familiar with.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inferno</li>
                        <li>Nuke</li>
                        <li>Mirage</li>
                        <li>Overpass</li>
                        <li>Ancient</li>
                        <li>Vertigo</li>
                        <li>Anubis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Spawns</h2>
                    <p>Spawns are where the team start their round from.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CT Spawn</li>
                        <li>T Spawn</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Sites</h2>
                    <p>These are the sites where the T, can plant the bomb.
                        <br> For a CT these are the places you hold while not knowing where the bomb is, as the T needs
                        to get to one of these places.
                        <br> On most map CT usually place two players on each of these sites, and one person between
                        them.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A</li>
                        <li>B</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Win conditions</h2>
                    <p>These are the normal win conditions for a single round. winning the MAP, means to first get 16
                        rounds.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defuse
                            <p>When a bomb is planted, it can be defused, if the CT defuse the bomb they win the
                                round.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>Bomb
                            <p>When the T plant the bomb, a timer starts. After the timer ends the bomb is exploded and
                                the T win the round.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>Kill all CT/T
                            <p>During the original round timer, if all players on one team dies, they lose the round.
                                <br> During a bomb plant, as a T you win if you kill all the CT, but as a CT you need to
                                defuse the bomb to win the round, even if you kill all the T.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Rounds</h2>
                    <p>
                        One half on one team, then switch at half point.
                        <br> Normally one half is 15 rounds, but the standard is to play best of 30 ( first to 16 ), so only the first
                        half is guaranteed to play to 15 on that team(ct, t)
                    </p>

                    <h2>Timers</h2>
                    <p>Timers are what's used most, this can change.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Freeze-time: 12 seconds (timer before a round start)
                            <br>it's very important to be done buying weapons when this time is over, so practice buying faster if you are not moving when the timer is up.
                        </li>
                        <li>Round: 1minute 55seconds (standard round timer, if bomb is not planted)</li>
                        <li>Bomb timer: 45 seconds (timer til it explodes, after being planted).</li>
                        <li>Defuse time is 10seconds but can be 5seconds with a defuse kit.
                            <br>Usually a 10second warning music starts playing when 10 seconds remain, try to use this
                            music to know when you still can defuse.
                            <br>(Meme: don't be a loser buy a defuser)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h2  id="movement">How to move, and where to move as a team</h2>

                <ul>
                    <h2>T</h2>
                    <p>As a T you need to get to either A or B to plant the bomb, as said earlier, the CT usually place
                        two players on A and two players on B,
                        <br> meaning that if as a T you walk 5 players into one site, it will usually be 5 v 2, giving
                        the T the upper hand and making it possible to plant the bomb.
                        <br> As a T you should play together and not to spread out, try to stick with your team.
                    </p>

                    <h2>CT</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a CT you are most often alone, or with one team-mate. If you see the T, you need to inform
                        your other CT players that the T is close, making them come to your help.
                        <br> If you as a CT hear a lot of noise on the communication and T getting kills on your team
                        members, you need to move to help that area, as the T is there
                        <br> And as said earlier, the T often moves together and not spread out to far, meaning that if
                        one T is at an area, there are more and they most likely are not where you are.
                        <br> So if you hear something, call it out and if you hear the info being called, you need to
                        help out.
                    </p>

                    <p>If the T has planted the bomb, the CT need to Retake and defuse the bomb.'
                        <br> as a CT you should wait for your team to be ready to enter the site, do not just walk in
                        alone.
                    </p>

                <h2>The basic of nades</h2>
                <h2 id="smoke">Smoke</h2>
                <p>The smoke grenade creates a medium-area smoke screen</p>
                <p>The smoke is used to remove angles, lets say you walk into a corner formed as an T, if you smoke of
                    one side, you only need to focus on the other.
                    <br> As a T, try to remember from where you often die, you can use that information to understand
                    where you should smoke.
                </p>

                <h2>Flash</h2>
                <p>The non-lethal flashbang grenade temporarily blinds anybody within its concussive blast</p>
                <p>The flash is used to blind the enemy team, making the enemy not able to see anything for a second or
                    two.
                    <br> this is often used when walking forwards, if you used a smoke on the left side, and you are to
                    walk right, but often die to a player there you can try flashing it first, then move.
                </p>

                <h2>Molotov</h2>
                <p>The Molotov is a powerful and unpredictable area denial weapon that bursts into flames when thrown on the ground, injuring any player in its radius</p>
                <p>This is used to avoid enemy to stay in one position
                    <br> often used during an "execute" (taking site). This is used in common angles, to not allow the
                    enemy to stand there while you enter.
                    <br> it can also be used to keep enemy off certain things, for instance the bomb. If it's 10seconds
                    left on the timer, a molotov that covers the bomb will most often make you win the round.
                </p>

                <h2>Nade</h2>
                <p>Grenade that burst dmg in an small area it explodes.</p>
                <p>The nade is used only if you have a specific plan with it, that's not often but some examples are:
                    <br> Nade a common awp angle, where awp has been playing.
                    <br> Nade stop rush, ( when all enemy run to a site )
                    <br> Nade/molotov combo to not allow early agression.
                </p>
                <h2>Decoy</h2>
                <p> When thrown, the decoy grenade emulates the sound of the most powerful weapon you are carrying </p>
                <p>The decoy is very easy to distinguish from normal shooting sounds, so it's not very much used,
                    <br> but a use case can be on a pistol round, you can throw it towards A, then go B, this will create some confusion but not much.
                </p>

                    <br> If you "think" something, keep it to yourself. Give information of what is happening lets say a nade is thrown, say 1 nade from -positon-
                    <br> If you hear, many steps running banana on B, you can call xAmount of ppl running banana.
